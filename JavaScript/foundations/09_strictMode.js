//===================//
//====STRICT MODE====//
//===================//

// Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:

// Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
// Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes run faster than identical code thatâ€™s not strict mode.
// Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
//Strict mode makes it impossible to accidentally create global variables.
//Strict mode makes assignments which would otherwise silently fail to throw an exception
//Strict mode requires that function parameter names be unique.
//Strict mode forbids setting properties on primitive values.

"use strict"; //has to be the first line in code in order to work

// The entire contents of JavaScript modules are automatically in strict mode, with no statement needed to initiate it.
